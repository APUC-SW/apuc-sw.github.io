# About TSCUP
TSC Universe Project(Hereinafter "TSCUP") is a science fiction universe for our game projects. It's a balance between hard and soft SF. It's usually written as hard SF, but this is simply to match the reality of physics, economics, sociology, politics, etc., and the actual content itself can be closer to soft SF.

# How is this different from other RP universes?
It is fundamentally no different from other role-playing universes (e.g. Orion's Arm, SCP, etc.). TSCUP can also be considered a role-playing universe, and if I had to name one thing, it would be that the main purpose is to focus on game development, not community expansion.<br>
Community extensions are welcome, but we are always cautious when adding these unofficial elements.

# What works inspire you?
This was inspired by the Half-Life series and Portal series, so most of the story elements may have somewhat similar feelings.
<br>

# What your game projects are based on this universe?
Most projects, with a few exceptions.
Source-based mods are excluded. Because these only based on Half-Life Universe.
