# What is this?
This mod is a realistic genetics modification mod. It may function as a spiritual successor to the Mad Science mod, but it is fundamentally a completely different mod as there is no contact with the creator of that mod.
<br>

It's will be provides new features(or todo list):
- CRISPR based modular DNA modifications.
- Blood extractable from any mob, animal, NPC entities and of course Player entities by using syringe.
  - A unique ID is assigned based on the mob entity's species and it's own UUID.
  - To put the same blood in a fluid container, the unique ID must be the same (to prevent mixing by mistake).
  - Blood imported in Creative Mode is a useless dummy fluid that does not have a unique ID.
- Blood can be centrifuged to extract DNA.
  - Of course a unique ID is assigned based on the mob entity's species and it's own UUID.
  - Items must have the same unique ID to be stacked in a same slot.
- Realistic DNA analyze and modification.
- Can make a spawn egg. But not using lightning. (Electric powered)
  - Can make a custom spawn egg too!
- Can make a mutant yourself.
  - DNA modification.
    - Customizable server-side skin configure.
  - Or do not DNA modification but just equips implants like a cyberware from the Cyberpunk 2077 if you don't want to be a zombie or weird mutant.
- Pathogen transmission and hygiene mechanism.
- Biological gender support. (Sex. Not a gender identity.)
- Medical drugs for surgical, experiments or treatment. (Narcotics not included)

<br>

And will **NOT** be provides feature is:
- Kidnap function. (Please do **NOT** ask about content with a high risk of copycat crimes.)
- Narcotics drugs. (Do **NOT** suggestion this idea.)
- Other content and features that may be at risk of copycat crimes or are unethical.

<br>

## Why is there no news on the development status yet?
Because it's huge scale mod and the developers only one(APUcard).
Requires more developers or technical supports.
