# Welcome to our official project wiki
This page is under construction. Currently testing the new experimental features.<br>
You are now seeing Project Developer Documentation Wiki.

## Overview
This page is wiki index page.<br>
This document is will be completed to write soon as fast if possible.

## Why are you promoting your site/project?
This is a consolidated documentation site for the projects. While it may contain redirect URLs for the project, it does not contain any form of advertising for the project. Therefore, this wiki itself is purely non-commercial.<br>
We may provide redirect links to wiki articles to help users find help using the service, but we do not directly promote our official wiki itself. If you see a post that appears to be promoting the wiki, <b>do not click on the link.</b>

## Can I see the revisions of each document?
No, this is a small wiki intended solely for developer documentation. It's not intended to be an encyclopedia, so we have no plans to add a feature that allows you to easily retrieve the repository's Git commit revision history. It's like a product manual doesn't show all revisions.
