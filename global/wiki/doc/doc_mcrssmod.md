# What is this?
This mod is provides extended systems for Minecraft vanilla survival system, but it's focuses to more compatibilities with tech mods.
<br>

It's will be provides new features:
- New survival status of thirty, toilet(Two type), stamina(separated from hunger status), hygiene, temperature(numeric), humidity(percentage), body sensitivity(special), etc.
- Changes MC vanilla breath status to be more detailed. (e.g. O2, CO2, N2, water level/pressure status for tech mods)
- More detailed damage status and related effects. (e.g. Fracture, bleeding, etc.)
- Clean water and dirty water with tech mod compatibility. (e.g. Put the dirty water to Mekanism boiler and make a clean water, etc.)
  - Potions are basically treated as clean water.
- Provides biological gender for player and server-side configure file. (Sex. Not a gender identity.)
- ~~Other popular mod supports. (e.g. MCA Reborn, Custom NPCs, Easy NPC, etc.)~~
- API for other mods.

<br>

And will **NOT** be provides feature is:
- Toilet, Sink, and Bath.
  - **Reason**: Because this is not an furniture mod. Adding this and improving compatibility with tech mods will eventually require an external dependency mod, whether we like it or not. But, it is not that there are no plans to add it at all. Currently reviewing these.
- S*x. (Do not ask about NSFW contents.)
- Other suggestions not mentioned in 'provides new features' section.

<br>

## Why is there no news on the development status yet?
Because it's huge scale mod and the developers only one(APUcard).
Requires more developers or technical supports.
