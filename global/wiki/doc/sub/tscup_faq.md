# FAQ
## How is this different from other RP universes?
It is fundamentally no different from other community-based role-playing universes (e.g. Orion's Arm, SCP, etc.). TSCUP can also be considered a role-playing universe, and if I had to name one thing, it would be that the main purpose is to focus on game development, not community expansion.
Community extensions are welcome, but we are always cautious when adding these unofficial elements.<br>
Unlike other RP universe projects, TSCUP isn't set in the distant future or past. It's set in the near future, primarily between the 19th and 25th centuries, in the alternative history genre.

## When will it officially open?
There is no release date set yet, and it will be announced later unless there is an unexpected catastrophic disaster in the real world, such as war, natural disaster, martial law declaration, terrorism/riot, etc.

## What works inspire you?
This was inspired by the Half-Life series and Portal series, so most of the story elements may have somewhat similar feelings. However, since it did not directly transfer or inherit the Half-Life universe, the content may be fundamentally different.

## What your game projects are based on this universe?
Most projects, with a few exceptions.
Source-based mods are excluded. Because these only based on Half-Life Universe.

## Can I contribute to this project?
Unfortunately, we currently have no plans to address this request. However, we will review the plan and provide further information once we receive at least 50 requests.

## Can I create something based on this universe?
Unfortunately, we are not currently accepting this request. Many aspects of this work are still incomplete and subject to frequent revision. Therefore, from the creator's perspective, frequent revisions to this work could significantly burden their future creative endeavors, and we therefore officially discourage derivative works.
